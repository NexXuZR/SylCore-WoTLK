# Introduction

SylCore is a custom World of Warcraft emulation core based on **AzerothCore**. After experiencing recurring issues with bugs and breaking changes in upstream updates, I decided to create SylCore to provide a more stable and feature-rich alternative for server administrators and developers.

The goal of SylCore is to:
- **Improve stability** by addressing bugs and issues present in upstream updates.
- **Add new features** to enhance custom server experiences.
- **Foster a welcoming and collaborative community** free from toxicity.

---

## What’s the Plan for SylCore?

### 1. Feature Enhancements
- Introduce new and exciting features to empower server customization.
- Example: Glyph slots can now be dynamically unlocked at customizable levels, eliminating the need for manual source code modifications.

### 2. Improved Lua Scripting
- Develop **sylcore-eluna-mod**, an enhanced version of mod-eluna, with additional features and events.
- Suggestions and ideas from the community are welcome!

### 3. Code Improvements
- Refactor and comment the source code extensively to make it more accessible and understandable for developers of all skill levels.

### 4. Community Focus
- Build a friendly and inclusive community where everyone can learn, share, and collaborate without fear of toxicity.
